# EtherGeo  

EtherGeo is a decentralized service of geographic location. It is going to be a significant component of decentralized application. 

# Motivation  

While in the process of building a delivery network which is a decentralized delivery service, we realized that it still lacks such fundamental service for era 3.0 of Blockchain. Although we are currently able to build delivery network based on centralized local information, it is a necessary future trend of ecosystem of Blockchain to make a geographic service based on peer-to-peer network consensus.

# Technical Strategy  

EtherGeo does not begin from nothing. Through enough experience of the research of peer-to-peer and Blockchain consensus, we are developing EtherGeo closely with the latest Blockchain technology.

# Challenge  
It is a hard task. 
• How to make maintenance for decentralized geographic information and keep timeliness and effectiveness.
• How to be stable enough to run the application and keep return.
• How to build variety GIS services or co-work.
We hope we will go beyond Nakamoto’s expectation, and all of you are willing to share your opinion.
